# Welcome to Product Analytics Dashboard
This dashboard displays a list of products with full sorting and filtering support. You can open the product details by double-clicking a row or clicking on the product title.

Product images are displayed with a carousel using ng-owl-carousel-o, and sales data is visualized using ng2-charts with a bar chart for monthly sales and a pie chart for sales status.

Built with Angular 20, Tailwind CSS, Angular Material, NgRx SignalStore, RxJS, and ngx-datatable.
